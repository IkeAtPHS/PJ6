When you grade this, look at "Graphics.htm".

"Graphics, I think.htm" was me following the instructions exactly, which didn't work well:

When I finished the project, I had duplicates of lots of elements, and the validator was throwing lots of errors about the code that was on the template.
Turns out that the template had INCORRECT JavaScript in it!

Fortunately the instructions had the correct code, so after comparing what the incorrect JS was supposed to do, and finding the correct code in the instructions, I replaced all the faulty code.
However, the instructions were extremely unhelpful in telling me what I was supposed to be doing, and didn't even mention the faulty code in the template.
If this "find and fix the errors" game was intentional, the instructions should mention that this is the goal.
If it's NOT intentional, then how do they expect anyone to understand these instructions?

In conclusion, because of TERRIBLE instructions, a project that should have taken me an hour tops took FOUR hours!
I have half a mind to drop this class and take your non-college classes, because at least for those, I can talk to the person who makes the instructions!

Thank you for listening to my TedTalk/Rant.
